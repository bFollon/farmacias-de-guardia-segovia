# Farmacias de Guardia Segovia

An iOS app that provides easy access to duty pharmacy schedules in Segovia, Spain.

## What the app does

This app helps residents and visitors of Segovia find which pharmacies are on duty (open) at any given time. It provides:

- **Real-time duty pharmacy information** for different regions of Segovia
- **Segovia Capital**: Downtown Segovia pharmacies
- **Cu√©llar**: Cu√©llar area pharmacies  
- **El Espinar / San Rafael**: Mountain area pharmacies
- **Segovia Rural**: Rural areas with ZBS (Basic Health Area) selection
- **PDF integration** with official duty schedules
- **Clean, native iOS interface** optimized for quick access

The app processes official PDF documents from health authorities to provide up-to-date pharmacy duty information in a mobile-friendly format.

## Disclaimers

### üöÄ Passion & Learning Project
This app was created as a personal passion project and learning experience. It started as a way to solve a real-world problem (finding duty pharmacies quickly) while exploring iOS development.

### üé® Entirely Vibe Coded
Fair warning: This entire app was "vibe coded" - meaning it was built using AI almost entirely. I am a Software developer and know what I'm doing, but expect some weird stuff in the codebase.

### üì± Not an iOS Developer
I'm not a professional iOS developer. This is my first serious attempt at building an iOS app, so expect some unconventional approaches and probably a few things that would make Apple's Human Interface Guidelines cry. But it was built with love and lots of trial and error!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Information Disclaimer
The duty pharmacy information shown is for reference only. Always confirm with official sources before relying on the information displayed. The app processes publicly available PDF documents but cannot guarantee real-time accuracy.

## Contributing

If you're an actual iOS developer and want to help improve this vibe-coded creation, contributions are very welcome! Whether it's fixing my questionable architecture decisions or adding new features, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

PD: Even this README file was vibe-written...so it's also built with lazyness.
