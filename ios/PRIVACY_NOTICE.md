# Privacy Notice - Farmacias de Guardia En Segovia

**Last Updated:** December 27, 2025

## Overview

Farmacias de Guardia En Segovia ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy notice explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.

The app includes **optional** application performance monitoring to help diagnose crashes and improve stability. **This monitoring is disabled by default and is only enabled if you explicitly opt in.**

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:
- Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other direct contact information
- User accounts, authentication credentials, or passwords
- Payment or financial information
- Advertising identifiers or data used for marketing or ad targeting
- Personal content such as messages, photos, or files
- Precise (GPS-based) location data stored or transmitted by us

## Information We Collect for App Monitoring

**Application performance monitoring is optional.**  
By default, the app does **not** send monitoring or diagnostic data. Monitoring is enabled only if you explicitly choose to opt in.

If enabled, the following technical and diagnostic information may be collected through New Relic Monitoring:

### Application & Performance Data
- App name, version, and build number
- App launch times, responsiveness, and performance metrics
- Crash reports, stack traces, and error logs
- Session duration and timing information

### Device & System Information
- Device type, model, and manufacturer
- Operating system name and version
- Carrier or network type (e.g., Wi-Fi or cellular)
- General hardware and memory usage metrics

### Identifiers (Pseudonymous)
- Session identifiers
- Device or installation identifiers generated by the monitoring SDK

These identifiers do **not** directly identify you as a person and are used only to correlate performance and crash data.

### Approximate Location (Network-Derived)
- Country, region, or city
- Network or autonomous system (ASN) information

This location information is inferred from network data and is **approximate only**.  
We do **not** collect or transmit precise GPS-based location data for monitoring purposes.

## Purpose and Use of Monitoring Data

All monitoring and diagnostic data is collected **solely** for the following purposes:

- Detecting and fixing application crashes and bugs
- Monitoring app stability and performance
- Improving reliability and user experience

**We explicitly do not:**
- Sell monitoring data
- Use monitoring data for advertising or marketing
- Build user profiles
- Track users across apps or services
- Attempt to identify real-world individuals


## Location Services

The app may request access to your device’s location only to:
- Find the closest pharmacy to your current position
- Display relevant pharmacy duty schedules for your area

**Important:**

- Approximate location information (such as city or region) may be inferred indirectly by New Relic via network diagnostics, as described above
- You can disable location services at any time in your device settings
- The app will continue to function without location access

## User Choices and Controls

Your choice is respected immediately and does not affect your access to pharmacy schedules or location-based features.

## Data Storage
